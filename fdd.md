# Functional Design Document (FDD) — UA Facility Management System

## 1. Overview

The UA Facility Management System is a role-based web application that centralizes facility reservations, utilization requests, and maintenance coordination for the University of Antique. It supports:

- Public users (view‑only reservation calendar).
- GSU admins (full control over facilities, reservations, and users).
- College staff (manage college facilities and submit reservation requests).
- Organization staff (submit and track facility utilization requests).

This document describes the functional behavior of the system from a user and business perspective, independent of implementation details.

## 3. Core Functional Areas

### 3.1 Facilities Management

**Owner:** Admin (GSU), College staff (for college‑owned facilities).

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Admin can:
   - Create facilities with:
     - Name, location.
     - Owner type: `gsu`, `college`, or `org`.
     - Owner college (optional).
     - Description, active flag, availability status (`available`, `unavailable`, `maintenance`).
   - Edit any facility.
   - Delete facilities.

2. College staff can:
   - Create facilities where:
     - Owner type is implicitly `college`.
     - Owner college is the staff member's college.
   - Edit facilities belonging to their college.
   - Delete their college facilities.
   - Cannot change core facility ownership or global GSU facilities.

3. Facility availability:
   - `available`: can be reserved.
   - `unavailable` or `maintenance`:
     - Cannot be reserved by the automated request→reservation flow.
     - Public calendar still shows existing reservations for historical transparency.

---

### 3.2 Facilities Utilization Requests

**Owner:** College staff, Org staff; reviewed by Admin.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Form fields (College & Org)**:
   - Date of activity (must be ≥ 7 days from today).
   - Start time and end time (end > start).
   - One facility selection (from active facility list).
   - Purpose of activity.
   - Equipment quantities:
     - Monobloc chairs, tables, fans, rostrum, flag & school color, sound, LED wall.
   - Noted‑by signatory (predefined or custom).
   - System captures requester identity (user, unit) and date of request.

2. **Overlap check at request time:**
   - System validates that the chosen facility has no overlapping `reserved` reservations in the requested time range.
   - If overlap exists, the request is rejected with a clear message.

3. **Status lifecycle (FormSubmission):**
   - `pending`: newly submitted requests.
   - `approved`: admin has approved; request still needs signing and conversion to reservation.
   - `reserved`: request has been converted into a reservation.
   - `disapproved`: request denied by admin.
   - `cancelled`: requester has cancelled a pending request (college or org).

4. **Cancel request (College & Org):**
   - A requester may cancel **only while status is `pending`**.
   - After cancellation:
     - Status becomes `cancelled`.
     - Request is hidden from "pending approvals" on admin side but visible historically.

5. **College/Org views:**
   - List of own requests (status != 'reserved'), filterable by:
     - Control number.
     - Status.
     - Activity date.
   - Detail page shows:
     - Request metadata.
     - Facility and time.
     - Purpose.
     - Equipment breakdown.
     - Signatory information.
     - Cancel button when status is `pending`.

### 3.3 Reservations (Bookings)

**Owner:** System (via approved requests), Admin (direct/high‑priority).

**Terminology Note:** The system uses `reserved` as the canonical active status. Older `booked` values are normalized to `reserved`.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Creation from approved requests:**
   - Admin selects an approved utilization request.
   - System validates:
     - Request status is `approved`.
     - Facility is `available`.
     - No overlapping `reserved` reservations.
   - On success:
     - Creates a `Booking` with status `reserved`.
     - Links it to the facility (many‑to‑many).
     - Updates the request's status to `reserved`.
     - Sends notifications to requester and admins.

2. **Direct high‑priority reservations (admin):**
   - Admin can bypass the request flow to create direct reservations.
   - Direct reservations:
     - Can span multiple facilities.
     - Convert any overlapping `reserved` reservations for those facilities to:
       - `pending` (conflict is pushed back for renegotiation).
     - Notify affected requesters that their reservation has been preempted.

3. **Statuses (Booking):**
   - `reserved`: active reservation.
   - `rescheduled`: reserved but modified by admin (time/facilities changed).
   - `completed`: end time is in the past (auto‑set).
   - `cancelled`: cancelled by admin.
   - Old `booked` values are mapped to `reserved` on migration/boot.

4. **Auto-completion:**
   - On each app boot, the system:
     - Converts any leftover `booked` bookings to `reserved`.
     - Marks `reserved` bookings with `end_time < now()` as `completed`.

5. **Modification (Admin):**
   - Admin can:
     - Change facilities.
     - Change date/time.
     - Update purpose.
     - Adjust equipment block.
     - Provide a reschedule reason.
   - System sets status to `rescheduled`, stores reschedule note, notifies requester and co‑admins.

6. **Cancellation (Admin):**
   - Admin can cancel an existing reservation.
   - Requires a cancellation reason.
   - Status becomes `cancelled`.
   - Reason is stored and sent via notification.

7. **College/Org reservation views:**
   - "My Reservations" pages show only `reserved` / `rescheduled` reservations for the requesting user.
   - Filters: search by facility/purpose, status, facility, month.

---

### 3.4 Calendars

**Owner:** Public, Admin, College, Org.

**Common behavior:**

- Calendar shows days in a month with dots or styling for days containing reservations.
- Hover or title text indicates number of reservations.
- A right‑hand "Upcoming Reservations" list highlights the next few reservations.

**Views:**

1. **Public home calendar (`/`):**
   - Route: `home` → `PublicCalendarController@index`.
   - Shows all `reserved` + `rescheduled` reservations within the month.
   - Navigation stays on `/` with `?month=YYYY-MM#calendar`.

2. **Admin reservation calendar (`/admin/calendar`):**
   - Same visual calendar partial, but route name is `admin.calendar`.
   - Shows all system reservations (reserved/rescheduled).
   - Admin context (within admin layout).

3. **College calendar (`/college/calendar`):**
   - Same shared partial; route name `college.calendar`.
   - Shows:
     - Reservations created by the college staff member, plus
     - Reservations for facilities owned by that college.

4. **Org calendar (`/org/bookings` and `/org/calendar`):**
   - Shared partial; `calendarRoute = 'org.bookings.index'` or `org.bookings.calendar` depending on view.
   - Shows active reservations, read‑only.

### 3.5 Notifications

**Owner:** All authenticated roles.

**Functional Requirements:**

- Each substantive event produces one or more in‑app notifications:
  - `form_pending`: request submitted.
  - `form_approved`: request approved.
  - `form_disapproved`: request disapproved.
  - `booking_created`: reservation created from request.
  - `booking_rescheduled`: reservation changed by GSU.
  - `booking_preempted`: reservation preempted by a direct booking.
  - `booking_cancelled`: reservation cancelled by GSU.
  - `form_pending_admin`: new request submitted (to all admins).
  - `booking_rescheduled_admin` / `booking_cancelled_admin`: admin‑side alerts.

- Users can view all notifications, see unread vs read, and mark individual ones as read.

---

## 4. Security & Access Rules (Functional)

- Only authenticated users may access dashboards or modify data.
- Role middleware enforces:
  - `/admin/*`: admins only.
  - `/college/*`: college_staff only.
  - `/org/*`: org_staff only.
- College and org users can only:
  - View and modify their own requests and reservations.
  - College facility edits are constrained to the user's college.
- Public users have no write access.

---

## 5. Data Normalization Rules

- On migration/boot:
  - `bookings.status = 'booked'` → `reserved`.
  - `form_submissions.status = 'booked'` → `reserved`.
- Auto‑completion:
  - `reserved` bookings with `end_time` earlier than now become `completed`.
- Overlapping checks always consider `reserved` as the active state to avoid conflicts.

---

## 6. Non‑Functional Points (High‑level)

- Monochrome admin UI with consistent black/white styling across dashboards.
- Shared calendar partial for public and all roles to minimize UI drift.
- Document generation uses official DOCX templates and produces PDF output for GSU forms.

This FDD should be the primary reference for how the system is expected to behave from the user perspective, especially around reservations, statuses (`reserved` vs `completed`), and role‑based actions.
